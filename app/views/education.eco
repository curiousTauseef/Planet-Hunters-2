        <h2>Can I use Planet Hunters 2 in the classroom?</h2>
        <p>Yes! Planet Hunters, like all the Zooniverse projects, offers students a unique opportunity to explore real scientific data while making a contribution to cutting edge research! We would like to stress that it's okay if students don't mark all the features correctly since each light curve is seen by multiple volunteers.  The task itself is simple enough that we believe most people can take part and make a worthwhile contribution regardless of age.</p>
