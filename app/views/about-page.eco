        <h1>The Story So Far...</h1>

        <p>On December 16, 2010, the <a href="http://www.zooniverse.org">Zooniverse</a> launched the original Planet Hunters to enlist the public's help to search data from the NASA's <a href="http://kepler.nasa.gov">Kepler</a> spacecraft for the characteristic drop in light due an orbiting extrasolar planets (exoplanets) crossing in front of their parent stars.</p>

        <p>Back then we didn't know what we would find. The project was a gamble on the ability of human pattern recognition to beat machines just occasionally and spot the telltale dip from a transiting planet that was missed by automated routines looking for repeating patterns. It may have been the case that no new planets were discovered and that computers had the job down to a fine art.</p>

        <p>The gamble paid off. The original Planet Hunters project discovered a bounty of unknown planet candidates and several confirmed planets, resulting from the efforts of nearly 300,000 volunteers worldwide. You can learn more about the discoveries and scientific results from the first iteration of Planet Hunters with our <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/publications?project=planethunters">list of published papers</a> and the <a href="http://blog.planethunters.org">project blog</a>.</p>

        <p>Nearly 4 years after the launch of the original Planet Hunters, the current phase (version 2.0) of the Planet Hunters project has been built with the Zooniverse's latest technology. You can learn more about the project on the <a href="#/science">Science page</a>. Like the original site, you'll be shown ~30 days worth of Kepler observations to review in the main classification interface. If you spot a transit-like feature in the light curve, mark its location. Other citizen scientists will be shown the same light curve and we'll combine the assessments to identify possible planet candidates for follow-up. In the Round 2 review phase of the project, you'll help inspect and confirm possible transit candidates identified in the main classification interface for further follow-up and inspection by the Planet Hunters science team.</p>

        <p>Who knows what we'll find? If the original Planet Hunters is any indication, then we're in for a surprise or two!</p>
