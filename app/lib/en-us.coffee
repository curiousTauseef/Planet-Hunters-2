          <p>Welcome to Planet Hunters. With your help, we are looking for planets around other stars.</p>
          <p>NASA's Kepler spacecraft is one of the most powerful tools in the search for extrasolar planets (exoplanets), planets orbiting stars outside of our own Solar System, and its discoveries continue to revolutionize our understanding of how planetary systems grow and evolve. Approximately every 30 minutes, Kepler monitors the brightness of many thousands of stars simultaneously for the signature of exoplanets via the transit technique. When an exoplanet passes or transits in front of its parent star, the star momentarily dims. This decrease in brightness is detectable by Kepler and lasts for a few hours or more and repeats once per orbit of the planet.</p>
          <p>The time series of brightness measurements for a star is called a light curve. Automated computers are sifting through the Kepler light curves looking for the repeating signal of a planet transit, but we think there will be planets which can only be found via the innate human ability for pattern recognition. At Planet Hunters we are enlisting the public's help to inspect the Kepler light curves and find these planets missed by automated detection algorithms. No training required! All you need is your keen eyes and a web browser to join the hunt.</p>
          <p>It's just possible that you might be the first to know that a star somewhere out there in the Milky Way has a companion, just as our Sun does. Fancy giving it a try?</p>

        content        :
          '''
          <h2>What am I looking for?</h2>
          <p>A small portion of a star's light is blocked out when an exoplanet passes or transits in front of it. The star winks and this dimming of starlight lasts for a few hours or more, repeating once per orbit of the planet. Visitors to the Planet Hunters' website are asked to draw boxes to mark the locations of these dips on the star's light curve (measurements of the the star's brightness over time). The depth of the transit and how often it repeats tells us about the relative size of the planet and its orbital period (how long the planet's year is).</p>
          <h2>Computers vs. Humans: Why do we need your help?</h2>
          <p>The Kepler team and other astronomers have developed automated computer algorithms to search the Kepler light curves, for the repeated signal of exoplanet transits. To date over 3000 confirmed planets and planet candidates have been discovered with Kepler, but the Kepler light curves are complex, many exhibiting short-lived changes in brightnesss that are often difficult to characterize. Despite the impressive success of the computers, they may miss transits dominated by the starâ€™s natural variability. The human brain excels at pattern recognition and easily recognizes transits that sophisticated automated routines may miss, and that is where you come in.</p>
          <p>Automated routines have been very successful and many planets and planet candidates have been found, but not all. While we expect computer programs to robustly identify things that they are trained to find, we know there are surprises in the data that the computer algorithms will miss. It is impossible for a single person to review all of the Kepler observations, and  experiments have shown that when many people work together, the collective wisdom of the crowds can be better than an expert. With the Internet we can gather the help of hundreds of thousands of people to hunt for exoplanets. The original Planet Hunters proved that this citizen science approach to exoplanets works with over 30 planet candidates and several confirmed planet discoveries.</p>

          <h2>The Transit Technique for Hunting Planets</h2>

            <p>Transits occur when a planet passes in front of its host star as viewed from the Earth. A portion of the star's light is blocked out, and the brightness observed decreases.The Kepler mission measures the brightness of stars with such incredible precision that it is sensitive enough to detect transits of planets approaching the size of the Earth. At Planet Hunters, we need your help in the hunt for extrasolar planets (exoplanets) by highlight potential transits in a star's light curve, the time series measurements of the star's brightness, in the web interface. We use the combined assessment of several volunteers reviewing the same 30-day segment of a Kepler star's light curve to identify transits.</p>
            <img src="images/phtransit.png"><br>

            <p>Not all planets will transit their host stars. A special orientation of the orbit is required. Because the technique looks for a dimming in the brightness of the star, all of the planets with orbits that donâ€™t pass between the star and our line of sight will be missed. For those planets that due transit, a transit will occur once every orbit.</p>

            <img src="images/transit_edges.png"/>

            <p>The bigger the planet, the more starlight that is blocked out and the bigger the transit dip. Below weâ€™ve taken a Kepler light curve from a star thatâ€™s about the same size as the Sun and have simulated what the effects would be if a few different types of planets were to transit. A Jupiter-sized planet produces a large 1% drop in light as it transits across a Sun-like star. Rocky planets generate a much smaller dimming, with the Earth only producing a 0.01% drop in our Sun's light! Larger planets around same-sized stars will be easier to detect than those of terrestrial planets with the transit method.</p>

            <img src="images/enj_example.png">
            <p class="image-caption">Credit: M. Giguere (Yale)</p>

            <p>The size of the star matters too. The same planet transiting a smaller star will have a larger transit depth. Earth-sized planets orbiting cool small M dwarfs, have the similar transit depths to giant planets around Sun-like stars.</p>

            <img src="images/learn-lightcurve.png ">

            <p>Given that our own Solar System has eight planets, it should come as no surprise that we may find other stars with multiple planets around them lurking in the Kepler data. These light curves would look exactly as one might guess, showing multiple patterns of transits.</p>

            <p>We can see that there must be multiple transiting objects because the timing between the transits is not constant due to the overlapping of two different periods. If you encounter a light curve that looks like it may be from a multiplanet system, mark the transits as usual. With your markings weâ€™ll be able to identify there is more than one planet present.</p>

            <img src="images/multitransits.png">

          <h2>Starspots</h2>

            <p>Like our Sun, many stars have cooler and fainter blotches on their surface. These starspots (or sunspots in case of the Sun) rotate with the star and cause relatively slow changes in the brightness of the light curve. Starspots cause most of the smooth and slowly varying brightness seen in stars typically over periods of days. Transiting planets cause produce changes in a starâ€™s brightness over much shorter timescales.  Planets will transit the star in  a few to tens of hours, causing quick dips in the star's brightness. Below is a light curve of a star with starspots and a transiting exoplanet. The transits are denoted by red boxes.</p>

            <img src="images/guide/more_examples4.png"><br>
            <h2>Planet Candidates vs Confirmed Planet</h2>

            <p>I spotted a transit, is it a planet? Maybe. There are several astrophysical scenarios not involving planets that can produce transit-like events in a Kepler light curve. So more checks first need to be done before we can confidently say the event is likely due a transiting planet.</p>

            <p>The first check is to see if the event repeats. Typically 2-3 transits must be spotted before the star is considered to harbor possible planets. A planet that orbits in one year, like the Earth, requires three years of data for detection, while planets that orbit in ten days can be detected with just thirty days of data. If the planet orbits longer than the ~30 day intervals we show on the Planet Hunters classification interface, you might only see one transit. If the event is real then other volunteers will have seen and marked the repeat events in other light curve sections, flagging the star as likely having transits.</p>

            <p>The transit technique measures the radius of the transiting body. If we know the size of the star, from the transit depth we know the size of the object. If there are repeat events and the size of the object is planetary in size, roughly Jupiter-sized (10 Earth radii) or smaller, we then call this a planet candidate.</p>

            <p>The reason for planet candidate and not confirmed planet is because we don't have the mass of the body. Brown dwarfs, low-mass stars that burned deuterium but not hydrogen in their cores, have similar radii to Jupiter but much heavier masses. From the radius alone you can't distinguish the two. Also Kepler has very precise but blurry vision. There are many background stars that contribute to a target star's  light curve, so we're seeing the combined light of all those sources. If background stars are bright enough they can dilute the transit signal making us think the body is smaller such than an eclipsing binary, where two stars transit in front and behind each other, can have measured depths that look like planet transits. A mass estimate will distinguish between an orbiting star and a planet.</p>

            <p>If a statistical analysis can rule out possible astrophysical false positives for the transit-like signal or a mass is measured, than the planet candidate gets promoted to confirmed planet. Most stars that Kepler observes are too faint or the planet candidates are too small to currently measure masses with ground-based radial velocity techniques. Therefore most planet candidates found in the Kepler light curves will remain candidates, but Kepler's aim was to be a statistical mission.</p>

          <p>The light curves, time series of brightness measurements, we ask you to inspect for planet transits come from the publicly released observations from NASA's <a href="http://kepler.nasa.gov/">Kepler mission</a>. On Planet Hunters, we show data obtained during two different phases of the Kepler mission:  </p>

          <h2>The Kepler Field</h2>
            <p>Kepler has spent four years staring at a single patch of sky, simultaneously monitoring a collection of stars for the tell tale signatures of transiting exoplanets. From May 2009-May 2013, Kepler observed nearly the same ~170,000 stars in the Kepler field located in the constellations of Cygnus and Lyra. Kepler suffered a mechanical failure that now prevents it from being able to point at the Kepler field, ending this period of its main mission.</p>

            <p>We have still have much of the four years of Kepler field data to search through. The original Planet Hunters project barely scratched the surface of the Kepler field observations. We think there is still much to be learned from the original Kepler data and likely to be unknown planets lurking in the light curves missed by the computers waiting to discovered.</p>

          <h2>K2</h2>
            <p>The Kepler spacecraft has been repurposed for the <a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/">K2 mission</a>. For the next several years, Kepler will be observing a new patch of sky every 75 days in the ecliptic plane. In each of these fields, Kepler will monitor brand new sets of 10,000-20,000 stars. These stars are different from the sources that Kepler had been monitoring in the past in the Kepler field. K2 observations will be made available to the entire astronomical community and the public shortly after being transmitted to Earth and processed.Your eyes will be one of the first to gaze upon these observations. Most of the K2 target stars will have never before been searched for planets, providing a new opportunity to find distant worlds.</p>

        content        :
          '''
          <p>One of the goals of Planet Hunters is to explore the diversity of the terrestrial and giant planet populations and begin to understand the spectrum of solar systems. With just the planet discoveries alone you can't answer these questions because you don't know how complete the sample is. In order to understand how well different kinds of transiting planets can be found with Planet Hunters, we also show light curves with simulated transits, spanning the range of exoplanet radii and orbits.</p>

          <p>It might seem like we're testing you or trying to train you to identify transits, but we're really testing the project. The simulations are critical for determining the statistical completeness for planets as a function of size (depth of the transit event) and orbital period (number of transits). This is a really vital part of the project, with these simulated transits we can answer interesting and fundamental questions about how solar systems and planets form. Some of the simulated planets like large Jupiter-sized planets will be really easy to spot while others will be near impossible to identify especially for the extremely small planets, but donâ€™t be discouraged if you didnâ€™t find the simulated transit. Thatâ€™s okay, that's part of the experiment.</p>

          <p>If you encounter a simulation, we will always identify the simulated transit points in red after youâ€™ve classified the star and list the properties of the simulated planet we injected into the light curve. The reason we donâ€™t identify the simulated data first, is that if you knew the light curve had simulated events you might look at it differently. To be able to use the data from the simulated transits accurately, we need them to be examined in exactly the same conditions as the real light curves.</p>

          <p>The observations we show on Planet Hunters come from the NASA Kepler spacecraft. They are brightness measurements of stars in the Kepler field during the main Kepler mission and from fields observed in the K2 phase. You can learn more about the Kepler field and K2 on the science page. NASA is archiving the Kepler data products and resulting catalogs at the <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler">Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST)</a> and the <a href="http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/KeplerMission.html">NASA Exoplanet Archive</a></p>

          <p>You can go to the star's Planet Hunters Talk page and make a 140 character comment, label the star with a hashtag, start a side discussion, or post a new thread in Talk's message board forum. On Talk you can discuss and further analyze the available data for the star as well as interact with the rest the Planet Hunters community including members of the science team. You can directly access Talk after classifying a star's light curve or at <a href="http://talk.planethunters.org">http://talk.planethunters.org</a></p>
          
          <h2 id="faq-classification">What happens to my classification after I submit it?<img class="faq up-image link" target="faq-top" src="images/icons/faq-up.png"/></h2>
          <p>It is stored in the Zooniverse's database with everyone elseâ€™s classifications from Planet Hunters. The Planet Hunters science team then will combine and analyze the results to identify planet candidates and estimate the occurrence of different types and kinds of planets and solar systems. Keep an eye on the <a href="http://blog.planethunters.org">Planet Hunters blog</a> for updates.</p>
          
          <h2 id="faq-mistake">I made a mistake, can I got back and edit my classification?<img class="faq up-image link" target="faq-top" src="images/icons/faq-up.png"/></h2>
          <p>Once you've finished reviewing a specific light curve and your classification has been submitted to our database, you canâ€™t go back and change it. Don't worry too much. Just try to do your best when reviewing the light curves. We combine the assessments from multiple volunteers to identify transits, so chances are if one person missed a transit by mistake the other classifiers will likely have marked it.</p>
          
          <h2 id="faq-correct">How do I know if I'm doing this right?<img class="faq up-image link" target="faq-top" src="images/icons/faq-up.png"/></h2>
          <p>We don't know where all the planet transits are, otherwise we wouldn't be asking for your help. Several Planet Hunters volunteers review each light curve and the results are then combined to identify transits. Chances are if you think a feature in a light curve is a transit and it is real, the other volunteers will have marked it too. You may come across a light curve with known planet candidates in it or a simulation. You can check if you identify those transits, but don't worry too much. Just use your best judgment when classifying.</p>
          
          <h2 id="faq-discoveries">Do I get credit for my discoveries?<img class="faq up-image link" target="faq-top" src="images/icons/faq-up.png"/></h2>
          <p>Yes, everyone who contributed to discovering an exoplanet is acknowledged in some way. If you are the first person to flag a particular transit as a potential exoplanet, and we can confirm that it is real or it is a focus of a paper, then we will offer to make you a co-author of the discovery paper. All others after the first will be acknowledged for their contribution on the website and in the paper.</p>

          <p>Yes, you do need to register and log in when classifying to get credit for your discoveries. It's the only way we know for sure that you were the one that marked the transit and will be able to contact you about the discovery.</p>
          
          <h2 id="faq-name">Do I get to name the exoplanet I found?<img class="faq up-image link" target="faq-top" src="images/icons/faq-up.png"/></h2>
          <p>Not yet, but maybe one day in the future you will be able help name your discovery. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) has enacted a plan for the public naming of extrasolar planets (exoplanets). The first set of exoplanets will be officially bestowed names in August 2015. You can find out more about the IAU's naming process at the <a href="http://nameexoworlds.org">Name ExoWorlds</a> website.</p>
          
          <h2 id="faq-candidate">Why can't you say the transits I spotted are a bonafied planet? What is a planet candidate?<img class="faq up-image link" target="faq-top" src="images/icons/faq-up.png"/></h2>
          <p>With the Kepler light curve alone, we can't be 100% certain that a transit-like feature is produced by an orbiting planet. There are many astrophysical false positives that can mimic a transit signature. Therefore we call discoveries planet candidates. A lot of effort and follow-up is required to confirm a planet candidate. To validate a planet candidate as a true planet, an estimate of the mass of the transiting body is needed. The transit method only gives an estimate of the size of the body, not its mass. Through statistical means or if a mass measurement is obtained and confirmed to be planetary, then the planet candidate gets promoted to a confirmed planet. To measure the mass typically radial velocity observations are used, where you measure the wobble of the star due to the slight gravitational tug due of the orbiting body. Most of the stars Kepler observes are either too faint or the planet orbiting is too small to have a radial velocity signal detectable by today's best ground-based telescopes and instruments. The majority of planet candidates found in the Kepler data will remain candidates.</p>
          
          <h2 id="faq-known">Why do some light curves already have known planet candidates?<img class="faq up-image link" target="faq-top" src="images/icons/faq-up.png"/></h2>
          <p>The Kepler team, other astronomers, and the original Planet Hunters project have been searching the Kepler field data for several years. There are many known transiting planet candidates discovered during this period. We highlight the known planet candidates in the Kepler field data after you finish your classification, so you know if you are finding a new discovery. Even if there is a known planet candidate found by others, we need to know if Planet Hunters can find it in order to be able to do accurate planet frequencies, so your clicks on these stars are just as useful as on stars without known planets. Even though a light curve may contain the transits of a known planet candidate, there might also be transits from an additional previously undetected planet.</p>
          
          <h2 id="faq-gaps">Why are there gaps in the light curves?<img class="faq up-image link" target="faq-top" src="images/icons/faq-up.png"/></h2>
          <p>The gaps in the data are typically due to the Kepler spacecraft not observing or the data quality is bad typically such as a cosmic ray hitting the detector.</p>
          
          <h2 id="faq-simulations">Why are there simulated transits?<img class="faq up-image link" target="faq-top" src="images/icons/faq-up.png"/></h2>
          <p>The simulated transits will enable the science team to understand exactly what kinds of planets the project can find and which ones are difficult for humans to spot by eye in the light curves. We will use this information to estimate the abundance of planets in our Galaxy. You can learn more about the simulations on the Science Page.</p>

  # INITIAL TUTORIAL
  initialTutorial:
    first:
      header: 'Welcome!'
      content: 'This short tutorial will show you how to find undiscovered planets by looking at how the brightness of a star changes over time.'

    theData:
      header: 'The Data'
      content:  'Each point on the light curve represents one measurement of a star\'s brightness taken by NASAâ€™s Kepler Space Telescope. These measurements are taken approximately every 30 minutes. The higher the dot, the brighter the star appears.' 

    xAxis:
      header: 'The Data'
      content: 'The x-axis represents the time spent observing the star. Usually each graph shows about 30 days of observations.'
      caption: 'This part of the light curve shows the time spent observing the star.'

    yAxis:
      header: 'The Data'
      content: 'The y-axis of the light curve shows the star\'s observed brightness.'

    transits:
      header: 'Transits'
      content: 'As the planet passes in front of (or transits) a star, it blocks out a small amount of the starâ€™s light, making the star appear a little bit dimmer. Youâ€™re looking for points on the light curve that appear lower than the rest. When you spot a potential transit, mark each one on the light curve.'

    markingTransits:
      header: 'Marking Transits'
      content: 'Try marking this transit (highlighted in red). Click and then drag left or right to highlight the transit points. Release the mouse button when you\'re done. You can go back and adjust the box width by selecting the transit box and using the handles.'

    spotTransits:
      header: 'Can you spot the transits?'
      content: 'Depending on how far the planet is from the star, you may see one or many dips in the light curve. Most transits that youâ€™ll typically see span a few hours to a day. Try marking the remaining transits in this example light curve.'
    
    showTransits:
      header: 'Did you spot them?'
      content: 'The remaining transits have been highlighted in red. Each light curve is reviewed by several volunteers so don\'t be discouraged if you missed a hard to spot transit. Transit hunting can be tricky and requires practice. Just do your best.'

    zooming:
      header: 'Zoom'
      content: 'You can use the zoom tool to look at the light curve in more detail. When zoomed in, you can use the slider along the bottom of the light curve to scroll through. You can toggle the scale of the zoom by clicking the magnifying glass here.'
