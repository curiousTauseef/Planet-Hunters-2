  tutorial:
    welcome:
      header: 'Welcome!'
      details: 'You\’re looking at data from the Kepler Space Telescope to find undiscovered planets by observing how stars\’ brightness changes over time.'

    theData1:
      header: 'The Data'
      details:  'This graph is a light curve showing how the brightness of one star changes over 35 days. The x-axis represents the time spent observing the star. Usually each graph shows 35 days of observations.' 


    theData2:
      header: 'The Data (part 2)'
      details: 'The x-axis represents the time spent observing the star. Usually each graph shows 35 days of observations.'

    theData3:
      header: 'The Data (part 3)'
      details: 'The y-axis shows the star\'s observed brightness. Each point on the light curve shows one measurement of a star\'s brightness. These measurements are taken approximately every 30 minutes. The higher the dot, the brighter the star appears.'

    transits1:
      header: 'Transits'
      details: 'A transit is when a small object moves between your field of view and a larger object. In this case the large object is the star being observed and the smaller object could be a planet orbiting around the star.'

    transits2:
      header: 'Transits (part 2)'
      details: 'We can\’t see a planet transiting it\’s star directly. We can detect a change in the star\’s observed brightness. As the planet moves between the observer and the star, it blocks a small amount of the light emitted by the star, making it appear a little bit dimmer.'

    findingTransits:
      header: 'Finding Transits'
      details: 'You\’re looking for points on the light curve that appear lower than the rest. This indicates that for a period of time the star\’s observed brightness decreased, indicating that a planet may have been transiting it.'
    
    markingTransits1:
      header: 'Marking Transits'
      details: 'When you spot a potential transit, highlight each one on the light curve. Mark the transits that you see in this light curve.'

    markingTransits2:
      header: 'Marking Transits (part 2)'
      details: 'Next adjust each box to the width of the marked transit feature. Most transits that you\’ll see will be cover 0.5-3 days.'

    spotThem:
      header: 'Did you spot them?'
      details: 'Don\’t worry if you didn\’t mark all of them, spotting transits can be tricky. That\’s why multiple Planet Hunters volunteers observe each light curve! Just do your best.'

    thanks:
      header: 'Thanks!'
      details: 'Now you\’re ready to being hunting planets! Over your first few classifications we\’ll provide some additional information that will be useful as you help astronomers search for new worlds.'
